# NEO

`neo` is a project scaffolding tool that can create ready-to-use projects based on templates. It is somewhat
like `yeoman` but different too. First, there are no dependencies to the project, except the requirement of
a `Java Virtual Machine`. 

## Birth of Neo?

As I start working on **Adobe Experience Manager** big time, I realize that the only project scaffolding tool
that is available is `lazybones` which again is dependent on `sdkman`. `sdkman` is written in `shell`,
`cucumber`, and `grovy` and thus is very tightly tied to `*nix` systems. This in turn leaves that `lazybones`
itself can only run on `*nix*` or `*OSX*` systems. As many developers within the **Adobe Experience Manager** community,
use Windows for development, they are unable to utilize the power of `lazybones`.

This led to the birth of `neo` - which being entirely written in Java - can be used across all platforms.

## Why Neo?

Why do I had to write `neo` when I could have added a `yeoman` based **AEM** template. Many reasons:

* I haven't worked with `yeoman` before.
* Its based on `nodejs` that I don't have on my machine
* **AEM** is built on `Java` and thus a Java solution makes sense
* Security out of the box 
* Last but not the least, I love to code
* Allows for templates to be used from github/bitbucket/gitlab and more

To achieve security, neo only provides basic commands/directives for a script to work. All actions like
reading a file, writing a file, managing files/directories can happen only within the project folder specified.
One cannot just go outside the project folder to work.

There is no need to use the central repository that indexes all templates. You know of a repository on
Github/Bitbucket/Gitlab - specify the url and use the template directly.

## How does it work?

* A template is defined by presence of a `neo.json` file
* The file contains user parameters to be read, and processing actions that need to be performed
* Based on the template, all user input parameters are read
* Everything in the `data` folder (relative to `neo.json` file) is copied to project folder
* All files that have an extension of `txt`, `md`, `json`, `xml` are processed via Velocity for property embedding
* Once the `data` folder is copied, process execution starts
* All actions are performed sequentially as present in the template file

## Available commands

* addProperty - adds a property to current context
* copyDir - copy directory from base folder to project folder
* copyFile - copy file from base folder to project folder, without variable injection
* copyTemplate - copy file from base folder to project folder, without variable injection
* copyTemplateDirfile from base folder to project folder, with variable injection
* log - log the following line to logs
* mkdir - create a new directory in the project folder
* moveDir - move a directory within the project folder
* moveFile - move a file within the project folder
* printContext - print all context properties on console
* print - print a line to console
* rmdir - remove a directory from the project folder
* rmFile - remove a file from the project folder
* writeFile - write a new file in the project folder, without variable injection

## TODO commands

* zip
* unzip
* wget


## Road Map

* Allow to read templates from github/bitbucket and all
* Support for ZIP based templates
* Support for HTTP based template urls
* Auto-update check for tool
* Allow download/install of templates to local cache
* Allow clean up of local cache
* Support for `.neoignore` file in `data` folder
